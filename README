This is my attempt to look at past NCAA tournament data and use it to predict
the winner of this years tournament.

The data is being taken from www.kenpom.com and pasted into an excel spreadsheet.
I then trim it to the tournament teams and make that into a csv file.

NOTES:
I'm running a sed script on the csv file I make to get the wins and losses from 34-3 to 34,3
I achieve this with the following sed script
sed s/-/,/ StatsInput.csv > StatsOutput.csv
